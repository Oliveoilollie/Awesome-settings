# Awesome-settings
just my awesome themes and some extra stuff i configured. yes i understand that the compositor i use is old

just git this in `/home/ollie/.config/awesome/` back up your current one just in case

dont forget these programs 
`yay -S openrgb flameshot nitrogen lxsession volumeicon nm-applet xfce4-settings`
i forgot what AUR for comption so look it up lol

------------------------------------------------------
because idk how to git properly you gonna need to make a copy of the default theme, move it to awsome .config folder and copy and paste lol im sorry

follow this it helps-- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Awesome, its upto date and i dont have to type much more.

btw this is just a backup of my stuff ill make a better repository when i figure this out
